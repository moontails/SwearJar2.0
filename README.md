#Swear Jar 2.0
Our hack at #BattleHack Chicago 2015.

Our app is the classic SwearJar with a twist. It allows you to challenge your friends and help them reduce swearing and at the same time donate the money collected in the jar to charity. 

Our app is integrated with
- [JustGiving](https://api.justgiving.com/docs) to help the users find and select charities.
- [Vemo](https://developer.venmo.com/) to make the donations.

Technologies used 
- Ionic (HTML5 and AngularJS) framework for the frontend
- Firebase to power the app's backend, including data storage and user authentication.

#App Workflow

- To start off, users can sign up user creates and logs into the app. They can then create a quest to challenge a friend.
